                For example, some districts may close at just 2 inches of snow,
                while others in snowy regions may remain open unless there’s
                over 8 inches. By customizing your school type and policy, our{" "}

            What Is a Snow Day Calculator and How Does It Work?
          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            A snow day calculator is an online prediction tool that estimates
            the likelihood of school closures, delays, or schedule changes
            during severe winter weather. It works by combining real-time local
            weather forecasts with past closure data from school districts in
            your region. Using this information, the tool can provide a
            percentage-based probability that your school will close, giving
            families a way to plan their mornings without relying solely on
            last-minute announcements.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            People often refer to it as a snow day predictor, school closure
            calculator, or winter storm delay estimator. Regardless of the name,
            the purpose is simple—to help students, parents, and teachers make
            informed decisions about commuting, childcare arrangements, and
            lesson planning before a storm hits. For many, it has become a
            winter tradition to check the calculator the night before a major
            snow event.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The process is straightforward. You enter your location, select your
            type of school or district, and sometimes input additional details
            such as expected snowfall amounts, ice warnings, or wind chill
            levels. Based on this data, the calculator runs it through a model
            that weighs each factor, producing a more precise forecast than
            simply glancing at the evening news or guessing from the sky
            outside.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Our snow day calculator works for cities and towns across both the
            United States and Canada, pulling from multiple weather data sources
            to ensure accuracy. The predictions are refreshed regularly as
            forecasts change, so checking back the night before and early in the
            morning gives you the best chance of seeing an up-to-date estimate.
            Whether it means an unexpected day off or just extra time to scrape
            the ice from your car, it’s a valuable tool for navigating winter
            mornings.

              A <strong>snow day calculator</strong> is a free online tool that

              workplace might close or switch to remote work. However, always
              confirm with your employer.

              Not necessarily. In regions accustomed to heavy snowfall, schools
